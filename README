= Ignite, a simple and robust init replacement

ignite is a set of scripts to boot Arch Linux using runit for service
supervision.

== Benefits

Robust, proven software: ignite is based on runit (which has been in
development since 2001), a high quality implementation of ideas dating
back to 1997 and earlier.

Simple configuration: ignite allows you to configure Arch using
/etc/rc.conf, like back in the old days.

Low overhead: runit-run is a tiny, statically linked binary that only
does the absolutely essential things.

Non-intrusive: ignite wont replace your cron, getty or syslog-ng.  You
are still free to do that yourself, if you want to.

Portability: the scripts can be easily adapted to other Linux
distribution, or even other unixish operating systems.

Full control: ignite will never start anything you didn't tell it
about.  ignite also supports read-only root file systems.

== Setup

READ THIS CAREFULLY OR YOUR SYSTEM WILL NOT BOOT SUCCESSFULLY.

Install runit-musl and ignite-git from AUR.  Ensure that you have at least
one agetty-tty1 process in DAEMONS.  Note that services mentioned in
/etc/inittab will not be picked up anymore.

Reboot with "init.sysv 6" after installation if you booted with sysvinit.

I recommend putting this line in /etc/pacman.conf to prevent sysvinit
from overwriting runit-init:

  NoUpgrade = sbin/init

== Configuration

ignite is configured using /etc/rc.conf and respects these variables:

HARDWARECLOCK=UTC|local
TIMEZONE=
KEYMAP=
CONSOLEFONT=
CONSOLEMAP=
MODULES=()  # prefix ! is not supported
USEDMRAID=no|yes
USEBTRFS=no|yes
USELVM=no|yes
HOSTNAME=   # or use /etc/hostname
DAEMONS=(alsa syslog-ng crond)  # see below, prefix ! disables

DAEMONS are checked against service directories in /etc/sv.  If they
exist, they are started, else "/etc/rc.d/$DAEMON start" is run (for
one-shot things).

Other runlevels can be defined in /etc/rc.conf as well by setting
$DAEMONS_foo to an array of services.  You can boot these by adding
runlevel=foo to the kernel command line.  There is a predefined
runlevel "single" which also can be triggered by appending "single",
"1", "S", or "-s" to the kernel command line.  It is predefined to
only start sulogin on tty1, and takes extra precaution to allow the
root filesystem to be (re-)mountable read-only.  The "emergency"
runlevel (or "-b") can be used to get a root shell in stage 2.

You can change runlevels in the running system by executing
"runsvchdir $runlevel".  This will shut down all services
that are not in the new runlevel, and start the missing ones.
Services defined in both runlevels will keep running.

== Additional Arch configuration points

* If you use syslog-ng, ensure that you source from
  'unix-dgram("/dev/log");' in /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.

== How it works

ignite uses runit, with "1 2 3"-scripts adapted from Arch initscripts
2012.05.1, back when they were plain bash scripts.  The "1 2 3"-
scripts are very straight forward, you can read them easily.

Phase 1 configures the system initially.  It can be interrupted at
almost any time by pressing C-c, which will drop you into a sulogin,
so you can change stuff.  Upon exiting this emergency shell, booting
resumes at that step

In phase 2, $DAEMONS scripts are linked to /run/runit/runsvdir/*, and
runsvchdir picks them up.  You can fiddle around there yourself, but
changes won't be persistent.  Use plain "runsv /etc/sv/$DAEMON" if you
just want to try a daemon and not permanently enable it.

Use shutdown/halt/reboot to enter phase 3, which stops all services,
runs the "/etc/rc.d/$DAEMON stop" actions when needed, unmounts
everything and lets runit turn off/reboot the machine.

== Limitations

- No support for non-UTF8 environments
- No crypttab support (add luksOpen/luksClose manually for now)
